AG08-RISK MANAGEMENT AGENCY,district of columbia,AG08,dis,,"The United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Risk Management Agency (RMA), created in 1996, serves America’s agricultural producers through effective, market-based risk management tools to strengthen the economic stability of agricultural producers and rural communities. RMA is committed to increasing the availability and effectiveness of Federal crop insurance as a risk management tool.

RMA manages the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) to provide innovative crop insurance products to America’s farmers and ranchers. Approved Insurance Providers (AIP) sell and service Federal crop insurance policies in every state through a public-private partnership with RMA. RMA backs the AIPs who share the risks associated with catastrophic losses due to major weather events. In addition, RMA assumes some of the risk generated by the crop insurance program administered by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

AG11-FOREST SERVICE,district of columbia,AG11,dis,,"What is the Forest Service?
We are a federal agency under the U.S. Department of Agriculture that manages 193 million acres of land, roughly the size of Texas.
We manage public lands in the form of national forests and grasslands, provide technical and financial assistance to state and private forestry agencies and make up the largest forestry research organization in the world.
When and why was the Forest Service established?
Congress established the Forest Service in 1905 to provide quality water and timber for the nation’s benefit.
Congress later directed the Forest Service to broaden its management scope for additional multiple uses and benefits and for the sustained yield of renewable resources such as water, forage, wildlife, wood, and recreation.
What does the Forest Service do?
We help people share and enjoy the forest, while conserving the environment for generations to come. Some activities are compatible. Some are not.
You, as a concerned citizen, can play a key role by expressing your views to Forest Service managers to help us strike a balance and make decisions in the best interest of the public lands and the public.
What is the Forest Service mission?
The mission of the Forest Service is to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of the nation’s forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations.
What is the Forest Service motto?
The Forest Service motto, “Caring for the Land and Serving People,” captures the spirit of our mission, which we accomplish through five main activities:

Protection and management of natural resources on lands we manage.
Research on all aspects of forestry, rangeland management, and forest resource utilization.
Community assistance and cooperation with State and local governments, forest industries, and private landowners to help protect and manage non-Federal forest and associated range and watershed lands to improve conditions in rural areas.
Achievement and support of an effective workforce that reflects the diversity of the American people.
International assistance to formulate policy and coordinate U.S. support for the protection and sound management of the world's forest resources.",Mission is short so I grabbed more of the page,https://www.fs.usda.gov/about-agency/meet-forest-service,,,"Chapter II	Forest Service, Department of Agriculture	200 – 299

AG16-NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION SERVICE,district of columbia,AG16,dis,,"For more than 80 years, we have helped people make investments in their operations and local communities to keep working lands working, boost rural economies, increase the competitiveness of American agriculture, and improve the quality of our air, water, soil, and habitat. 

Our Mission: We deliver conservation solutions so agricultural producers can protect natural resources and feed a growing world.
Our Vision: A world of clean and abundant water, healthy soils, resilient landscapes, and thriving agricultural communities through voluntary conservation. 

Supporting America’s Working Lands

As the USDA’s primary private lands conservation agency, we generate, manage, and share the data, technology, and standards that enable partners and policymakers to make decisions informed by objective, reliable science. 


And through one-on-one, personalized advice, we work voluntarily with producers and communities to find the best solutions to meet their unique conservation and business goals. By doing so, we help address climate change and ensure the long-term sustainability of American agriculture. We’re also focused on the American farmer, especially those underserved by our programs as well as those trying to break into new markets, like organics. More on our priorities.   


Rooted in the Dust Bowl

NRCS was born out of troubled times — the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s. Dust storms ravaged the Nation’s farmland, stripping away millions of tons of topsoil and carrying it all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. What originally began as the USDA Soil Conservation Service in 1935 is now known as the Natural Resources Conservation Service, a name change that highlights our broader mission of natural resource conservation. More on our history.


Our Work with Producers and Partners

Today, through voluntary conservation programs, NRCS helps producers, soil and water conservation districts, and other partners protect and conserve natural resources on private lands throughout the United States. With approximately 2,300 Service Centers in communities nationwide, NRCS and other USDA employees work side-by-side with producers in every State and territory. Producers can learn more or apply for a program by contacting your local Service Center. You can also learn more about our conservation solutions by watching our Conservation at Work video series or using our Conservation Concerns Tool. 


Meanwhile, we know we can’t do this work alone, and we work with conservation partners to develop conservation solutions.

AG18-ECONOMIC RESEARCH SERVICE,district of columbia,AG18,dis,,"The mission of USDA's Economic Research Service is to anticipate trends and emerging issues in agriculture, food, the environment, and rural America and to conduct high-quality, objective economic research to inform and enhance public and private decision making.

ERS shapes its research program and products to serve those who routinely make or influence public policy and program decisions. Key clientele include White House and USDA policy officials; the U.S. Congress; program administrators/managers; other Federal agencies; State and local government officials; and organizations, including farm and industry groups. ERS research provides context for and informs the decisions that affect the agricultural sector, which in turn benefits everyone with efficient stewardship of our agricultural resources and the economic prosperity of the sector.

As a federal statistical agency covered by the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Statistical Policy Directives, ERS is responsible for ensuring the quality, objectivity, and transparency of the statistical information it provides. Our policies and procedures for publishing research and data are designed to ensure that we provide high quality and objective analysis.

ERS research and analysis covers a broad range of economic and policy topics:

Agricultural Economy – farm sector performance and farm households’ well-being; farm size and concentration; market analysis, data, and projections on commodity supply, demand, and prices; and Federal farm policies
Food and Nutrition – U.S. food security, food and nutrition assistance programs, food choices and health outcomes, food access and store proximity, food retailing and marketing, and food prices
Food Safety – societal benefits associated with reducing food safety risks, economic impacts of food hazards, and potential results of regulation versus industry decisions
Global Markets and Trade – major markets and competitors, economic impacts of exports and imports, trade barriers, and potential trade agreements
Resources and Environment – economic impacts of conservation programs, efficacy of policies designed to protect the environment, and enhancing agricultural competitiveness through technology
Rural Economy – investments in rural communities and drivers of rural economic performance, demographic change and its impact on rural communities
ERS digitally publishes its research and analysis in economic research reports, articles in our award-winning Amber Waves magazine, data visualizations and data products throughout the year. ERS's suite of data products encompasses estimates, forecasts, and economic and statistical indicators.

In addition, the ERS commodity outlook program delivers timely, independent, and objective information about agricultural markets and provides projections of U.S. and world agricultural commodity production, consumption, and trade.

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration is made up of the Chief Administrative Office, Chief Human Capital Office, and Chief Procurement Office. Responsibilities are as follows:

The Chief Administrative Office (OCAO) is responsible of providing administrative and customer support to HUD employees.

The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) is responsible for developing and implementing policies and procedures associated with human capital management of the Department. The Chief Human Capital Officer also advises the Secretary and senior management on all human resource matters as well as setting the workforce development strategy for the agency.

The Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO) is responsible for obtaining all contracted goods and services required by the Department efficiently and in the most cost-effective manner possible to enable the Department to meet its strategic objectives. OCPO provides vital logistic support to the Department's program offices and other support offices in meeting their mission needs and provides leadership throughout the Department for fundamentally sound business practices.",This is a weird one: see classification notes for HUBB,https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/officeofadministration,,,none
HUBB-OFFICE OF THE CHIEF HUMAN CAPITAL OFFICER,,HUBB,exclude,"From somewhere in 2009 HUBB went from ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR ADMINISTRATION to OFFICE OF THE CHIEF HUMAN CAPITAL OFFICER. However, we can see from https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/officeofadministration that the CHIEF HUMAN CAPITAL OFFICER (OCHCO) is actually under the ASSISTANT SECRETARY. What explains this? I have no idea. I think in practice the agency-level entity really is the ASSISTANT SECRETARY, which controls three offices, including the OCHCO. Indeed, on https://www.hud.gov/program_offices it seems that the ASSISTANT SECRETARY is the equivalent level of other agency-level entities such as CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER, PUBLIC AND INDIAN HOUSING, and so on. For these reasons, even though seemingly HUBB changed from the Office of the Assistant Secretary to the OCHCO, I'm going to keep what seems the more appropriate name and exclude the OCHCO. However, in both cases these are both staff type agencies, so it shouldn't make a difference in the analysis.",The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) is responsible for developing and implementing policies and procedures associated with human capital management of the Department.

NN72-LYNDON B. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER,texas,NN72,dis,,"For more than 50 years, NASA’s Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston has led our nation and the world on a continuing adventure of human exploration, discovery and achievement. The center has played a vital role in powering our country into the 21st century through technological innovations and scientific discoveries.

The dedicated professionals who work at JSC have made advances in science, technology, engineering and medicine that enable us to explore our world and universe as never before, and to derive unparalleled benefits from that exploration.

The Johnson Space Center was established in 1961 as the Manned Spacecraft Center, the home and Mission Control Center for the U.S. human space flight program. In 1973, it was renamed in honor of the late President, and Texas native, Lyndon B. Johnson. 

The Johnson Center’s $1.5 billion complex occupies 1,620 acres southeast of downtown Houston, in the Clear Lake area.

JSC is the home of mission control and astronaut training. In its early days, the center led the Gemini, Apollo, Apollo-Soyuz and Skylab projects. JSC was the home of NASA’s Space Shuttle Program from 1981 to 2011, and currently leads International Space Station operations and missions, development of the Orion spacecraft and NASA’s Gateway outpost program, as well as numerous other advanced human exploration projects. The center also plays an important role in NASA’s Commercial Crew program.

As the center has evolved into one of NASA’s largest research and development facilities, the greater Houston area has developed into an aerospace hub with an identity of amazing achievements, hard work, and innovation.",,https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/about/index.html,,,none

TD17-FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY ADMINISTRATION,district of columbia,TD17,reg,,"Our Mission
The primary mission of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) is to reduce crashes, injuries and fatalities involving large trucks and buses.

The FMCSA was established as a separate administration within the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) on January 1, 2000, pursuant to the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999. FMCSA is headquartered in Washington, DC and employs more than 1,000 people in all 50 States and the District of Columbia, all dedicated to improving the safety of commercial motor vehicles (CMV) and saving lives.

Our Strategy
In carrying out its safety mandate to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities involving large trucks and buses, FMCSA:

Develops and enforces data-driven regulations that balance motor carrier (truck and bus companies) safety with efficiency;
Harnesses safety information systems to focus on higher risk carriers in enforcing the safety regulations;
Targets educational messages to carriers, commercial drivers, and the public; and
Partners with stakeholders including Federal, State, and local enforcement agencies, the motor carrier industry, safety groups, and organized labor on efforts to reduce bus and truck-related crashes.",,https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/mission,,,"Chapter III	Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, Department of Transportation	300 – 399

TRAF-FINANCIAL CRIMES ENFORCEMENT NETWORK,virginia,TRAF,staff,,"FinCEN is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Director of FinCEN is appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury and reports to the Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit use and combat money laundering and promote national security through the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence and strategic use of financial authorities.

FinCEN carries out its mission by receiving and maintaining financial transactions data; analyzing and disseminating that data for law enforcement purposes; and building global cooperation with counterpart organizations in other countries and with international bodies.

FinCEN exercises regulatory functions primarily under the Currency and Financial Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, as amended by Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and other legislation, which legislative framework is commonly referred to as the ""Bank Secrecy Act"" (BSA). The BSA is the nation's first and most comprehensive Federal anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CFT) statute. In brief, the BSA authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue regulations requiring banks and other financial institutions to take a number of precautions against financial crime, including the establishment of AML programs and the filing of reports that have been determined to have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, and regulatory investigations and proceedings, and certain intelligence and counter-terrorism matters. The Secretary of the Treasury has delegated to the Director of FinCEN the authority to implement, administer, and enforce compliance with the BSA and associated regulations.

Congress has given FinCEN certain duties and responsibilities for the central collection, analysis, and dissemination of data reported under FinCEN's regulations and other related data in support of government and financial industry partners at the Federal, State, local, and international levels. To fulfill its responsibilities toward the detection and deterrence of financial crime, FinCEN:

Issues and interprets regulations authorized by statute;
Supports and enforces compliance with those regulations;
Supports, coordinates, and analyzes data regarding compliance examination functions delegated to other Federal regulators;
Manages the collection, processing, storage, dissemination, and protection of data filed under FinCEN's reporting requirements;
Maintains a government-wide access service to FinCEN's data, and networks users with overlapping interests;
Supports law enforcement investigations and prosecutions;
Synthesizes data to recommend internal and external allocation of resources to areas of greatest financial crime risk;
Shares information and coordinates with foreign financial intelligence unit (FIU) counterparts on AML/CFT efforts; and
Conducts analysis to support policymakers; law enforcement, regulatory, and intelligence agencies; FIUs; and the financial industry.",,https://www.fincen.gov/what-we-do,,,"Chapter X	Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Department of the Treasury	1000 – 1099
